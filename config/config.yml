# Caching settings
cache:
  # NOTE: how long should objects be cached for by default
  msToLive:
    default: 900000 # 15 minutes
  # Default 'Cache-Control' HTTP Header to set for all static content (including compiled *.js files)
  # Defaults to max-age=604,800 seconds (one week). This lets a user's browser know that it can cache these
  # files for one week, after which they will be "stale" and need to be redownloaded.
  # NOTE: When updates are made to compiled *.js files, it will automatically bypass this browser cache, because
  # all compiled *.js files include a unique hash in their name which updates when content is modified.
  control: max-age=604800 # revalidate browser
  autoSync:
    defaultTime: 0
    maxBufferSize: 100
    timePerMethod:
      PATCH: 3 # time in seconds
  # In-memory cache(s) of server-side rendered pages. These caches will store the most recently accessed public pages.
  # Pages are automatically added/dropped from these caches based on how recently they have been used.
  # Restarting the app clears all page caches.
  # NOTE: To control the cache size, use the "max" setting. Keep in mind, individual cached pages are usually small (<100KB).
  # Enabling *both* caches will mean that a page may be cached twice, once in each cache (but may expire at different times via timeToLive).
  serverSide:
    # Set to true to see all cache hits/misses/refreshes in your console logs. Useful for debugging SSR caching issues.
    debug: false
    # When enabled (i.e. max > 0), known bots will be sent pages from a server side cache specific for bots.
    # (Keep in mind, bot detection cannot be guarranteed. It is possible some bots will bypass this cache.)
    botCache:
      # Maximum number of pages to cache for known bots. Set to zero (0) to disable server side caching for bots.
      # Default is 1000, which means the 1000 most recently accessed public pages will be cached.
      # As all pages are cached in server memory, increasing this value will increase memory needs.
      # Individual cached pages are usually small (<100KB), so max=1000 should only require ~100MB of memory.
      max: 2000
      # Amount of time after which cached pages are considered stale (in ms). After becoming stale, the cached
      # copy is automatically refreshed on the next request.
      # NOTE: For the bot cache, this setting may impact how quickly search engine bots will index new content on your site.
      # For example, setting this to one week may mean that search engine bots may not find all new content for one week.
      timeToLive: 86400000 # 1 day
      # When set to true, after timeToLive expires, the next request will receive the *cached* page & then re-render the page
      # behind the scenes to update the cache. This ensures users primarily interact with the cache, but may receive stale pages (older than timeToLive).
      # When set to false, after timeToLive expires, the next request will wait on SSR to complete & receive a fresh page (which is then saved to cache).
      # This ensures stale pages (older than timeToLive) are never returned from the cache, but some users will wait on SSR.
      allowStale: true
    # When enabled (i.e. max > 0), all anonymous users will be sent pages from a server side cache.

    # outdated content (based on timeToLive)
    anonymousCache:
      # Maximum number of pages to cache. Default is zero (0) which means anonymous user cache is disabled.
      # As all pages are cached in server memory, increasing this value will increase memory needs.

# Theme Config
themes:
  # Add additional themes here. In the case where multiple themes match a route, the first one
  # in this list will get priority. It is advisable to always have a theme that matches
  # every route as the last one
  #
  # # A theme with a handle property will match the community, collection or item with the given
  # # handle, and all collections and/or items within it
  # - name: custom
  #   handle: 10673/1233
  #
  # # A theme with a regex property will match the route using a regular expression. If it
  # # matches the route for a community or collection it will also apply to all collections
  # # and/or items within it
  # - name: custom
  #   regex: collections\/e8043bc2.*
  #
  # # A theme with a uuid property will match the community, collection or item with the given
  # # ID, and all collections and/or items within it
  # - name: custom
  #   uuid: 0958c910-2037-42a9-81c7-dca80e3892b4
  #
  # # The extends property specifies an ancestor theme (by name). Whenever a themed component is not found
  # # in the current theme, its ancestor theme(s) will be checked recursively before falling back to default.
  # - name: custom-A
  #   extends: custom-B
  #   # Any of the matching properties above can be used
  #   handle: 10673/34
  #
  # - name: custom-B
  #   extends: custom
  #   handle: 10673/12
  #
  # # A theme with only a name will match every route
  # name: custom
  #
  # # This theme will use the default bootstrap styling for DSpace components
  # - name: BASE_THEME_NAME

  - name: custom
